# Snake-Game-in-c-
I This repository contains the implementation of the classic Snake Game using C++. The game is played in the terminal, where the player controls a snake that grows longer by eating food while avoiding walls and its own tail. The goal is to achieve the highest score without colliding into obstacles.

Features:
1. Terminal-based gameplay with simple controls using arrow keys.
2. Snake movement and automatic growth as it eats food.
3. Dynamic difficulty, with the snake speeding up as it grows.
4. Score tracking and high score display.
5. Smooth user interface with a real-time game loop.

Controls:
Arrow Keys: Control the snake's direction (w/W->Up, s/S->Down, a/A->Left, d/D->Right).
